## Interactive Menu

When invoked interactively, present a two-level menu. See `references/interactive-menu.md` for the full menu structure.

## When to Use

- Image analysis and visual content extraction
- Reverse image search and source identification
- Visual verification of web content
- Screenshot analysis and OCR
- When any skill needs image understanding
- A flyer or poster → calendar event or ticket purchase draft
- A meal photo → macro estimation
- A storefront or sign → save to try-list
- A product photo → pricing comparison or order draft
- A civic issue photo → 311 report draft
- A receipt → expense entry
- A document → searchable PDF and filing draft

## When NOT to Use

- Image generation (use Imagine)
- Video processing or analysis
- Bulk image processing at scale
- Real-time camera feed analysis
- Generic OCR utility
- Background surveillance or tracking
- Generic automation framework
- Images where the user has no clear intent in mind

## Workflow

The image-to-draft workflow routes user images through intent inference, domain routing, and draft generation. This workflow exists because raw images alone are not actionable — the agent must extract structured meaning before proposing next steps.

1. **Ingest** — Accept user-provided image (file, URL, or paste)
2. **Classify intent** — Determine domain (event, meal, place, product, receipt, document, civic)
3. **Extract** — OCR, vision analysis, reverse image search as needed
4. **Generate draft** — Produce actionable output (calendar entry, macro estimate, expense log, etc.)
5. **Confirm** — Present draft to user for approval before acting

Example: a user provides a flyer image → agent classifies as "event" → extracts date/venue → generates calendar draft → confirms with user.

## Responsibility boundary

Look owns image-to-action conversion: ingest, context inference, domain routing, draft generation, and execution with confirmation.

Look does not own: web research (Sift), preference persistence (Taste), communications (Dispatch).

## Ontology types

Look works with these types from `spec-ocas-ontology.md`:

- **Entity/Person** — people identified in images (public figures, named contacts).
- **Place** — venues, locations, and scenes extracted from image context.
- **Concept/Event** — events visible in images (gatherings, occasions, dated scenes).
- **Thing/DigitalArtifact** — the source image itself.

Look includes entity signals in journal payloads using the Signal schema from `spec-ocas-shared-schemas.md`. The `payload.type` field must be set to the ontology type of the primary extracted entity (`Person`, `Place`, `Event`, or `DigitalArtifact`). `source_journal_type` is `"Observation"`.

## Supported domains

Events, food macros, places, products, civic issues, receipts, documents.

Read `references/domain_playbooks.md` for detailed per-domain behavior.

## Core workflow

See `references/workflow.md` for the full step-by-step procedure, error handling table, and clarification rules.

## Commands

- `look.ingest.image` — ingest image(s) with optional EXIF and device pre-parse
- `look.propose.actions` — generate ActionDrafts with DecisionRecords
- `look.execute.action` — execute a confirmed draft (requires explicit approval)
- `look.rollback.action` — attempt rollback for reversible actions
- `look.status` — last ingest, pending drafts, items awaiting confirmation
- `look.config.set` — update configuration
- `look.journal` — write journal for the current run; called at end of every run
- `look.update` — pull latest from GitHub source; preserves journals and data
- `lookup.reverse_search` — perform Google reverse image search on an image URL or local file. Returns matching pages, titles, and similar image URLs.

## Confirmation and rollback rules

- Draft-first always. No execution without explicit confirmation.
- High-risk actions (purchases, 311 submission, health writes): require per-draft confirmation token.
- Reversible actions (calendar, maps): expose rollback information.

## Permission discipline

Default deny. Request minimally. Drafting continues even without execution permissions. Blocked execution reported, not silently skipped.

## Boundaries

- Never invent OCR text, barcodes, prices, or license plates
- EXIF capture location is not the event venue
- iOS relay pre-parse is optional evidence, not truth
- The skill must work without relay upload

## Error handling

See `references/workflow.md` for the full error handling table.

## Reverse Image Search

Look uses reverse image search during step 5 (Research and validate externally). Primary method: Yandex Images via browser (works from cloud IPs). Fallback: `google-image-source-search` PyPI package (residential IPs only).

**Quick reference:**
- Local file → upload to Imgur first → public URL → Yandex search
- Already a public URL → use directly with Yandex
- Google fallback only on residential IP — never retry more than once from cloud

Detailed instructions: `references/google-image-source-search.md` (Google fallback), `references/credential-files.md` (Imgur client ID).

**Gotchas (also in Gotchas section):**
- Google blocks cloud IPs completely — use Yandex
- TinEye returns JS-rendered results — use browser
- Yandex results may contain Cyrillic tags — URLs still usable

## Storage layout

```
{agent_root}/commons/data/ocas-look/
  config.json
  state.json
  events.jsonl
  decisions.jsonl
  reports/
  artifacts/

{agent_root}/commons/journals/ocas-look/
  YYYY-MM-DD/
    {run_id}.json
```

Default config: see `references/default_config.md`.

## OKRs

See `references/okrs.md` for the full OKR definitions. Universal OKRs from spec-ocas-journal.md apply to all runs.

## Optional skill cooperation

- Sift — web research for validation during draft generation (via SearchX)
- Chronicle — entity signals emitted via journal payloads after draft generation

## Journal outputs

Observation Journal — all image ingestion and draft generation runs.

## Initialization

On first invocation of any Look command, run `look.init`:

1. Create `{agent_root}/commons/data/ocas-look/` and subdirectories (`reports/`, `artifacts/`)
2. Write default `config.json` and `state.json` if absent
3. Create empty JSONL files: `events.jsonl`, `decisions.jsonl`
4. Create `{agent_root}/commons/journals/ocas-look/`
5. Ensure journal payload fields (see interfaces specification) exists (create if missing)
6. Register cron job `look:update` if not already present (check the platform scheduling registry first)
7. Log initialization as a DecisionRecord in `decisions.jsonl`
8. **Reverse image search setup** (run once):
   - Read `references/pip-venv.md` for the full setup pattern (install `google-image-source-search`, pin `requests`, verify import)

## Background tasks

| Job name | Mechanism | Schedule | Command |
|---|---|---|---|
| `look:update` | cron | `0 0 * * *` (midnight daily) | `look.update` |

```
# Task declared in SKILL.md frontmatter metadata.{platform}.cron
```

## Self-update

`look.update` pulls the latest package from the `source:` URL in this file's frontmatter. Runs silently — no output unless the version changed or an error occurred.

See `references/self_update.md` for the full self-update procedure.

## Visibility

public

## Gotchas

- **Google reverse image search is blocked from cloud IPs** — Use Yandex Images via browser instead. Do not retry Google more than once.
- **Vision model config**: `vision_analyze` uses the `vision.model` and `vision.provider` fields in `config.yaml`, NOT the auxiliary model. Set to a vision-capable model like `nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl:free` (provider: openrouter). The agent cannot patch config.yaml directly — use `hermes config set vision.model <model>` or edit manually.
- **Reasoning model incompatibility**: Some free vision models (nex-agi/nex-n2-pro:free, nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-omni) are reasoning-only models that return `content: null` with the answer in `message.reasoning`. The `vision_analyze` tool doesn't handle this. Use `nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl:free` for reliable vision analysis.
- **Wikimedia image URLs blocked**: OpenRouter proxy returns 400 when fetching wikimedia.org image URLs. Use base64-encoded images or alternative image hosts.
- **LLM7.io has no free vision model**: GLM-4.6V-Flash is paywalled. Use OpenRouter free vision models instead.
- **EXIF location ≠ event venue** — The capture location embedded in a photo's EXIF data is where the photo was taken, not necessarily the event venue.
- **Never invent OCR text, barcodes, prices, or license plates** — If the image content is ambiguous, state uncertainty rather than guessing.
- **TinEye returns JS-rendered results** — Use the browser if TinEye is needed; it can't be scraped with curl.
- **Reverse image search requires a public URL** — Upload local files to Imgur first, then use the returned URL for Yandex reverse search.
